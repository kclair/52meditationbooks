					One of the major causes of fear is that we do not want to face ourselves as we are. So, as well as the fears themselves, we have to examine the network of escapes we have developed to ride ourselves of them.

					Is fear the result of thought? If it is, thought being always old, fear is always old. As we have said, there is no new thought. If we recognize it, it is already old. So what we are afraid of is the repetition of the old - the thought of what has been projecting into the future.

					There is no "individual" mind at all - we are all totally related. Please understand this. The mind is not something separate; it is a total mind. We are all conforming, we are all afraid, we are all escaping.

				<blockquote>
					Fear ceases only when there is direct contact. If I have no escapes at any level, I can look at the fact. I can look at the fact that I'm going to die, in ten years or in twenty years. I have to understand death, come into contact with it physically, organically, because I'm still alive.  I have plenty of energy. I'm still active, healthy. Bodily, I can't die, but physchologically I can die.
					This requires tremendous observation, going into, working. To die means that you have to die every day, not just twenty years from now. You die every day to everything that you know ... Otherwise you can't come into contact with them. If you die to them all, fear comes to an end and there is renewal.

					So there is time as the past, time as the present, and time as the future. In the now, all the past and the future are contained. So the future and the past exist now. I am the result of all the past, modifying itself in the present, and the future is in the present. Unless I radically bring about - or rather, unless there is - a mutation in my brain cells, I will be what I am now. So the present is the past and the fugure, contained now. That is time.
