				<p class="text-muted">One of the most powerful teachings of the Buddhist tradition is that as long as you are wishing for things to change, they never will. As long as you're wanting yourself to get better, you won't. As long as you have an orientation toward the future, you can never just relax into what you already have or already are. </p>

					Bodhichitta has three qualities: (1) it is soft and gentle, which is compassion; (2) at the same time, it is clear and sharp, which is called prajna; and (3) it is open. This last quality of Boddhichitta is called shunyata and is also known as emptiness. Emptiness sounds cold. However, boddhichitta isn't cold at all, because there's a heart quality -- the warmth of compassion that pervades the space and clarity.

					Slogan: "In post meditation, be a child of illusion." Being a child of illusion also has to do with not being a walking battleground. We have such strong feelings of good and evil, right and wrong ... the truth is that good and bad coexist, sour and sweet coexist. They aren't opposed to each other. We could start to open our eyes and our hearts to that deep way of perceiving, like moving into a whole new dimension of experience.

					Strangely enough, we blame others and put so much energy into the object of anger or whatever it is because we're afraid that this anger or sorrow or loneliness is going to last forever. Therefor, instead of relating directly with the sorrow or the loneliness or the anger, we think the way to end it is to blame it on somebody else .... Instead, acting it out is what makes it last.

					Reproach can be very powerful. You yourself teach yourself the dharma in your own words. You can teach yourself the four noble truths, you can teach yourself about taking refuge - anything that has to do with that moment when you're just about to recreate samsara as if you personally had invented it. Look ahead to the rest of your life and ask yourself what you want it to  add up to.
