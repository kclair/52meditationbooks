				<p class="text-muted">Actually this practice is just about the mind and its feelings. It's not something that you have to run after or struggle for. Breathing continues while working. Nature takes care of the natural processes - all we have to do is try to be aware. Just keep trying, going inwards to see clearly. Meditation is like this.</p>

					We can bring the practice all together as morality, concentration, and wisdom. To be collected, to be controlled, this is morality. The firm establishing of the mind within that controls is concentration. Complete, overall knowledge within the activity in which we are engaged is wisdom.

					It's natural for [the mind] to be calm for a while, and then restlessness and confusion may arise again. When this happens, concentrate, breathe deeply again, and then reestablish your attention on the breath. Just keep going like this.

					This practice requires endurance. Some people, when they come to practice, don't want to be bothered by anything, they don't want friction. But there's friction the same as before. We must try to find an end to friction through friction itself.<br>
					So, if there's friction in your practice then it's right. If there's not friction then it's not right.

					In Buddhism we say "Don't cling to anything". We never stop hearing about this "don't cling to anything!" This means to hold, but not to cling. Like this flashlight. We think, "What is this?" So we pick it up, "Oh, it's a flashlight", then we put it down again. We hold things in this way.
